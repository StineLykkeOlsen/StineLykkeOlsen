### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a tech writer, translator, and language nerd living and working i Central Denmark.

To hone my technical writing skills further, I am currently learning as much about coding and software documentation as possible. I have found that one of the best methods is to immerse myself in the magical world of tech lingo that is GitHub. Mostly, I don't understand much, but it is uplifting to se how I understand more and more as I dive into books, courses, and TouTube tutorials ðŸ”­

When I am not working as a translator, technical writer, subtitler - and mom, I practice aikido ðŸ¥‹ and archery :dart:
