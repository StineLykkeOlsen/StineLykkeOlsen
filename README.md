### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a tech writer, translator, and language nerd living and working i Central Denmark.

To hone my technical writing skills further, I am currently learning as much about coding and software documentation as possible. I have found that one of the best methods is to immerse myself in the magical world of tech lingo that is GitHub. Mostly, I don't understand much, but it is uplifting to se how I understand more and more as I dive into books, courses, and TouTube tutorials ðŸ”­

Formally, I hold a master's degree in Chinese and German Studies. 
Because I am curious and have multifaceted interests, I have worked in very different fields for the last 20 years as a:

database editor, senior lecturer in Chinese, German, and Latin, event coordinator, project manager, and technical writer and translator. 

When I am not working as a translator, technical writer, subtitler - and the all-encompassing, full time job as a mom, I practice aikido ðŸ¥‹, open water swimming :swimmer: and archery :dart:
