### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a tech writer, translator, and language nerd living and working i Central Denmark.

To hone my technical writing skills, I am currently learning as much about coding and software documentation as possible. I have found that one of the best methods is to immerse myself in the magical world of tech lingo that is GitHub. Mostly, I don't understand much, but it is uplifting to se how I understand more and more as I dive into books, courses, and TouTube tutorials ðŸ”­

Formally, I hold a master's degree in Chinese and German Studies. After ten years as a high school teacher I decided to change tracks a couple of years ago. Now I work in the energy/clean tech sector as a tech writer. 

When I am not working at my company or at home in the all-encompassing, full time role as a mom, I practice aikido ðŸ¥‹, open water swimming :swimmer: and archery :dart:
